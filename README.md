# Redux Intro

This repo covers the key aspects of redux and shows ways of using redux within react. It leverages popular approaches to using Redux with React and also demonstrates legacy methods. It serves as a starting point toward understanding how React and Redux work for gloabl state management in your app.

## Key Takeaways

- Redux can be used without React
- Redux createStore is used to create the store, and can combine reducers, as well as middleware like Thunk.
- RTK (Redux Toolkit) abstracts the complexity of Redux and enforces best practices
- RTK also allows us to use middleware, and combines the reducers and action creators in a "Slice"
- RTK is more involved in it's setup but preferred for larger applications
- State management can also be achived for smaller apps with Context API
